;;; Commentary:

;; This package extends the `hass' package to include a dashboard to configure
;; quick access to buttons and displays.

;; --------------------
;; Configuration

;; The primary `hass' package must be configured properly first before using
;; this dashboard feature.

;; The main configuration for the dashboard takes place with the
;; `hass-dash-layouts' variable.  `hass-dash-layouts' declares how the widgets
;; are laid out, what they display, and what they do.  See the docstring for
;; `hass-dash-layouts' for details.

;; --------------------
;; Full layout example

;; --------------------
;; Usage

;; To show the dashboard, call the `hass-dash-open' function.  Nothing fancy is
;; done to show this buffer so standard buffer management configuration
;; applies.  It can be handy to use packages like `popper' and/or `shackle' to
;; configure how the dashboard is displayed.
